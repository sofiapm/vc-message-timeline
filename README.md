# vc-message-timeline

`VC Message Timeline` sails.js API.
The project is a simple single-page application which allows users to create a message timeline where
users post and reply to messages.

The API was developed with Sails node.js framework and a MongoDB database.
The backend was kept as simple as possible to provide the necessary functions, but more complex functions such as user authentications, sessions and anything unrelated to the task were omitted.

Frontend can be foun [here](https://github.com/sofiapm/vc-message-timeline-angular/tree/release/v0.1.0)
